# What is this?
This is a simple demo that represents how you can generate a dynamic "Reactive Form" in Angular.

With this small demo, you just have to pass the type of field, name of the field, label, value, required, options (If checkbox, radio or dropdown).

And also, you have 2 events one is for submitting and the second is for onChange. With these functions, you can get the form value.

Your suggestions are welcome to improve this.
